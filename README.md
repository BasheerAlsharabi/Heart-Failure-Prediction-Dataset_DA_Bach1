# Heart-Failure-Prediction-Dataset_DA_Bach1


# Intro:
we made this project  as apart of training Data analysis using python  in Aiapproach club.


# Objective:
The aim is
Realization the diseases caused to heart disease and extract statistical information about heart disease. 


# About the dataset
This  data speaks about Heart Failure Prediction  . 
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worldwide. Four out of 5CVD deaths are due to heart attacks and strokes, and one-third of these deaths occur prematurely in people under 70 years of age. Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs and this dataset contains 11 features that can be used to predict a possible heart disease. 
People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk (due to the presence of one or more risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia or already established disease) need early detection and management wherein a machine learning model can be of great help.


Attribute Information:

1-	Age: age of the patient [years]

2-	Sex: sex of the patient [M: Male, F: Female]

3-	ChestPainType: chest pain type [TA: Typical Angina, ATA: Atypical Angina, NAP: Non-Anginal Pain, ASY: Asymptomatic]

4-	RestingBP: resting blood pressure [mm Hg]

5-	Cholesterol: serum cholesterol [mm/dl]

6-	FastingBS: fasting blood sugar [1: if FastingBS > 120 mg/dl, 0: otherwise]

7-	RestingECG: resting electrocardiogram results [Normal: Normal, ST: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV), LVH: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria]



8-	MaxHR: maximum heart rate achieved [Numeric value between 60 and 202]

9-	ExerciseAngina: exercise-induced angina [Y: Yes, N: No]

10-	Oldpeak: oldpeak = ST [Numeric value measured in depression]

11-	ST_Slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment [Up: upsloping, Flat: flat, Down: downsloping]
12-	HeartDisease: output class [1: heart disease, 0: Normal]

# Steps :
1-	Import libraries. 

2-	Import date 

3-	Check from null values.

4-	Check from duplicates rows. 

5-	Data Pre-processing and us notes. 


# Conclusion of project:

1-	The number of Heart disease is larger than the number of healthy cases 55 percent.

2-	The most of cases infected with heart disease are men. 

3-	The average age of heart disease is 55.8

4-	The most case have heart disease are cases that have Chest pain of type "Asymptomatic" and ST_Slope of type "flat".

5-	Through comparative between HEART DISEASE statistics and healthy situations, appear the cases heart disease that are have this is diseases : chest pain, Blood pressure, exercise angina, old peak, ST Slope.
